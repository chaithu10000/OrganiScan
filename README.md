# Organ-Wise Health Risk Scoring System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **health scoring system** that predicts the health status of individuals based on organ-specific assessments (Heart, Liver, Lung). The system uses **machine learning** (XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, and deep learning models) in combination with **clinical guidelines** (AHA, WHO, NIH) to generate **predictive health scores** for various organs and an **overall health score**. The scores are complemented by **personalized medical advice** based on individual health categories (Excellent, Good, Poor, Risky).

This project uses **KNHANES (Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)** dataset but can be adapted to other populations, including Indian patients, by fine-tuning the clinical thresholds and features.

## Project Description

This health scoring system aims to predict the **overall health score** and **organ-specific scores** (Heart, Liver, and Lungs) based on key clinical features such as **blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI**, and others. The model uses **ensemble techniques** (XGBoost + Deep Learning) for better accuracy and **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for interpretability.

### Key Components:
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Matrices, Pairplots, and 3D Scatter Plots
- **Feature Engineering**: Calculating **BMI**, creating **penalty-based health scoring** logic for each organ
- **Machine Learning Models**: **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, **SVM**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **MLP**
- **PDF Report Generation**: Personalized health reports with recommendations
- **Model Explainability**: SHAP for feature importance and interpretation
